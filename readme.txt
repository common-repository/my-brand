== Installation ==

**What To Do**

1. Download the zip to your hardrive.
2. Upload to your 'Plugin' Directory via On-site Uploader (zip).
3. Next Just Click 'Activate Plugin'. You're Done!
4. Options Page Under 'Appearance' in Admin Sidebar.

**The Following is only applicable if you're upgrading from version 1.6.3 and older:**

On some configurations when upgrading to version 1.6.5, the new version may become a duplicate folder and be named 'my-brand2'
IF that happens go into your server root (or install location of wordpress) and rename the folder back to 'my-brand' (Delete the other First)
That will ensure all functions and options work correct. This will NOT erase any of the database information, so all of your saves will remain.
*This has been noticed on some Multi-Site setups mainly*. 
If you are still having problems, please visit the support forum (http://forum.gdsweb.ca) and post a request for assistance.
